## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

First native release — the framework ships as OS-native bundles for Linux,
macOS, and Windows, built and published automatically from a `v*` tag.

### Added
- **Native `hkm` launcher** (Zig) for Linux, macOS (universal arm64 + x86_64),
  and Windows, cross-compiled from a single Linux host.
- **`hkm doctor`** — verifies PHP ≥ 8.4.1, required extensions
  (json, mbstring, ctype, tokenizer, filter, pdo, openssl, curl, fileinfo), a
  PDO driver, and reports the resolved kernel path.
- **`hkm version` / `--version` / `-v`** with a Sentinel ASCII banner.
- **`hkm upgrade [--check]`** — checks the repo's `v*` tags for a newer release
  and updates a git-checkout install (packaged installs get reinstall guidance).
- **Self-locating kernel** — the launcher finds the kernel relative to its own
  executable, so `.app`/zip/portable installs need no environment variable.
- **`tools/bundle.sh`** — assembles the `.deb`, macOS `.app` tarball, and Windows
  `.zip`; ships source (`src`, `plugins`, `projects`, `modules`) and resolves
  Composer dependencies on the target at install time (`vendor/` not bundled).
  `MODULES=git` mode fetches path-repo modules from pinned commits instead.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — PHPUnit + Zig cross-builds on push/PR to `main`.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — test-gated; builds all three
  OS bundles on Linux and publishes the GitHub release automatically.
- **Self-hosted Zig toolchain** fetch (`tools/ci/setup-zig.sh`) so CI is immune
  to upstream purging the pinned dev build.
- **Kernel unit test suite** (`tests/Unit/Kernel/`) — Identity, SecurityVerdict,
  FrameworkException/ValidationException, DependencyGraphCalculator, Request,
  Response (427 tests total, all green).

### Changed
- **Minimum PHP is now 8.4.1** (aligned with the actual Symfony 8 dependency);
  previously advertised as 8.2+.
- The kernel is packaged under `/opt/hkm-kernel` with `hkm` on `PATH`.

### Fixed
- PSR-4 autoloading violations: split `SeedCommands.php` into one class per file
  and excluded path-loaded `database/{seeders,migrations,factories}` from the
  classmap.
- Registered the Cookie and Pageflow support helpers in Composer's `files`
  autoload so their global functions resolve.
- Added a tracked `phpunit.xml.dist` so CI finds the test configuration
  (`phpunit.xml` is gitignored).
- Windows cross-compilation: guarded POSIX-only raw-mode TTY code.
