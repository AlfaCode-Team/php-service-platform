 *
 *   $factory = CliCommandFactory::fromConfig($config);
 *
 *   (new CLIApplication('MyApp', '1.0.0'))
 *       ->add(...$factory->all())
 *       ->discoverCommands()
 *       ->run();
 *
 * Every command returned from all() (or any grouped method) has the config
 * pre-injected — users do NOT need to pass --config=<path> on the CLI.
 * Passing --config at runtime still works as an override (useful for
 * switching between dev/staging/prod configs without rebuilding the binary).
 *
 * Adding a new command: register it in the appropriate grouped method
 * below and it will appear in all() automatically.
