/**
 * ModuleContainer — per-request, per-module scoped DI container.
 *
 * Built on the bind-it container ({@see \PHPShots\Common\Container}) for
 * reflection-based autowiring, with the GDA scope-isolation rules layered on
 * top. Scope isolation is real and enforced:
 *   - Every binding records the scope (module domain) that registered it.
 *   - bindInternal() bindings are resolvable ONLY from within their owning scope.
 *   - Resolving an internal binding from another scope throws ScopeViolationException.
 *
 * Caller scope is threaded automatically: while a binding is being resolved its
 * owning scope is pushed onto a resolution stack so nested make() calls inherit
 * it. ExecuteStage resolves the controller with makeInScope() using the route's
 * owning scope, so a module's controller can reach its own internal bindings,
 * but no other module can.
 *
 * The container is created fresh per request and discarded at the end — no state
 * leaks across requests, which is required for OpenSwoole worker safety.
